We would like to measure what the impact of increasing the minimum order delivery fee in a 
given city (not considering products value), from €1.9 to €2.1, would have on critical company 
KPIs. You are asked to design the experiment from the conceptual stage, plan empirical 
analysis, and present how recommendations would depend on the results of the experiment. 
Explain in detail how you would approach this task, focusing on the following: 

○ What kind of test would this 
require? 

This specific change in pricing will require a price test, A/B test could be doable depending on the laws of the country showing different prices to half of your customer can result in missleading and charges. 

○ Would you test this in new users only or all active users? Why? 
		I would test this for all users in that city, use the competitor's prices as a benchmark, and see the effects the increment does accross the board, let it run for 1 week 
○ What are the assumptions that you would make, and how would you test 
whether or not these assumptions hold? 
○ What would be the design of the experiment? 
○ What metrics will you measure to quantify the impact that this change has had 
on critical company KPIs? 
○ For how long would you run the 
test? 
○ How would you analyse the results of the test? 
○ What would your recommendations be depending on the 
results of the test? 

definen key metrics, like order volume customer recetention. 

total revenue of the order
minimum 2 weeks depending on the outcome of the data 
examine the 2 groups key metrics and compare them
check the amount of orders that are on the minimun delivery
